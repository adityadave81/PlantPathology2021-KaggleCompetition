# PlantPathology2021-KaggleCompetition

# Plant Pathology 2021 is a competition on Kaggle in which we need to identify the category of foliar diseases in apple trees. (https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-pathology-2021-fgvc8)
# In this model we created the labels of foliar diseases and based on the categorised the training images. After that we resized and reshaped the images and used "Sobel" for edge detection. After we got the matrices for images, we divided it by 1/255 in order to normalize it between 0 and 1. We used Multilayer Perceptron as our model. 

# We did this project on R.
